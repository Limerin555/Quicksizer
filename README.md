# Quicksizer
Quicksizer is a 4R image resizer that helps speed up your photobooth printing processes.

# Getting Started
Quicksizer should be pretty straightforward,
simply select a folder of files where you wish to resize & an output path for the exported files to be saved in, & click "Enter".

Quicksizer is not an executable yet, you will need Python installed in your system & the terminal to launch the Python script.
Open up the terminal, change to the script directory, type "python quicksizer.py" & Quicksizer should run.

# Prerequisites
Currently, Quicksizer only works for JPEG formated images & was only tested on 64-bit Windows 10.
Make sure JPEG files are larger than 4R size, which is equivalent to 1800px X 1200px & vice versa.
To get the best result, images must be in 4:3 ratio.

# Built With
Python 3.6.1

# Modules
os, tkinter, PIL, resizeimage

# Versioning
Quicksizer is nothing but a personal project & still in development, future version with more features may be released.
